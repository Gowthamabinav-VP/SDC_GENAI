            "Artificial intelligence is nothing but making computers-based machines think and act like humans. John McCarthy a computer scientist coined the term artificial intelligence back in 1956 but it took time to evolve as it demanded heavy computing power. There are three types of AI artificial narrow intelligence also called weak AI is the stage where machines think like people. Artificial narrow intelligence is the capacity to comprehend or pick up any intellectual skill that a human can. IBM's Watson supercomputer and gpt3 fall under this category. Machine learning is the process of automating and enhancing how computers learn from their experiences. Artificial intelligence is advancing in every crucial field like healthcare education robotics banking e-commerce and the list goes on like in healthcare AI is used to identify diseases helping healthcare service providers and their patients make better treatment and lifestyle decisions coming to the education sector AI is helping teachers automate grading organizing and facilitating parent conversations in robotics ai-powered robo. AI is about playing a computer game creating a device using your own intelligence to program an intelligent machine. The AI Market is expected to reach 190 billion dollars by 2025.
